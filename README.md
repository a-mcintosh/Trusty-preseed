IOUnote

Tested and working under 
*  VirtualBox 5.1.22 r115126
*  Host: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (trusty)
*  Guest: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (trusty)
*  Virtualbox extensions are installed

Shell scripts and preseed files to create an Ubuntu .iso image,
create a Virtualbox machine,
install Trusty Tahr mostly unattended (automatic).

Only 1 action is needed before the installation process starts, so that you don't accidentally burn a CD and later re-format your kid sister's computer.
