# Unattended install of Trusty
## Preseed file & environment 
### Custom lvm disk partition recipe

Tested and working under 
*  VirtualBox 5.1.22 r115126
*  Host: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (Trusty)
*  Guest: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (Trusty)
*  Virtualbox extensions are installed

Shell scripts and preseed files to 
*  create an Ubuntu .iso image,
*  create a Virtualbox machine,
*  install Trusty Tahr mostly unattended (automatic).

I do require 1 action before the installation process starts, so that you don't accidentally put a CD into a valuable machine and re-format the disks.
